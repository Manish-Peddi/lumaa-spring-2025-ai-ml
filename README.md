**Deadline**: Sunday, Feb 23th 11:59 pm PST

---

## Overview

Build a **content-based recommendation system** that, given a **short text description** of a user’s preferences, suggests **similar items** (e.g., movies) from a small dataset. This challenge should take about **3 hours**, so keep your solution **simple** yet **functional**.
